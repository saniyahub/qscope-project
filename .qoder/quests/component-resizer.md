# Component Resizing and Layout Optimization Design

## Overview

This design document outlines the implementation plan for component resizing and layout optimization in the QScope quantum computing visualization platform. The solution addresses two main issues:

1. Components like State Analytics and Educational Content using only a small portion of available space
2. Layout issues in the Bloch Sphere 2D visualization where components overlap and go out of boundaries

The implementation will include:
- Proper sizing of components using CSS properties (width, height, flex, grid)
- Implementation of a manual adjustable resizer using the react-resizable library
- Restructuring of the Bloch Sphere 2D component to prevent overlapping and boundary issues

Based on the project requirements, we need to implement:
- CSS properties like width, height, flex, and grid to ensure proper layout distribution
- Manual adjustable resizer for all components using the react-resizable library
- Layout fixes for Bloch Sphere 2D to prevent overlapping and boundary issues with proper containment

## Architecture

### Current Layout Structure

The QScope application currently uses a grid-based layout in the main App component:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[App Component] --> B[Navigation]
    A --> C[Toolbar]
    A --> D[Main Content Area]
    D --> E[Left Column - Circuit Builder]
    D --> F[Right Column - Visualizations]
    E --> G[CircuitBuilder]
    E --> H[LearningPanel]
    E --> I[AnimatedCircuit]
    E --> J[EntanglementExplanation]
    E --> K[StateAnalytics]
    E --> L[EducationalPanel]
    F --> M[BlochVisualizer/ProbabilityView/EntanglementView]
```

### Proposed Layout Structure

The new layout will implement resizable panels with proper containment:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[App Component] --> B[Navigation]
    A --> C[Toolbar]
    A --> D[Main Content Area - Resizable Grid]
    D --> E[Resizable Left Panel]
    D --> F[Resizable Right Panel]
    E --> G[CircuitBuilder - Resizable]
    E --> H[LearningPanel - Resizable]
    E --> I[AnimatedCircuit - Resizable]
    E --> J[EntanglementExplanation - Resizable]
    E --> K[StateAnalytics - Resizable]
    E --> L[EducationalPanel - Resizable]
    F --> M[Visualization Area - Resizable]
```

## Component Resizing Implementation

### React-Resizable Integration

To implement manual adjustable resizing, we'll integrate the `react-resizable` library:

1. Install the library:
   ```bash
   npm install react-resizable
   npm install @types/react-resizable  # For TypeScript support
   ```

2. Import required components:
   ```jsx
   import { ResizableBox } from 'react-resizable';
   import 'react-resizable/css/styles.css';
   ```

3. Create a reusable ResizablePanel component:
   ```jsx
   import { ResizableBox } from 'react-resizable';
   
   export default function ResizablePanel({ 
     children, 
     width = 400, 
     height = 500, 
     minWidth = 300, 
     minHeight = 300,
     maxWidth = 1000,
     maxHeight = 1000,
     onResizeStop
   }) {
     return (
       <ResizableBox
         width={width}
         height={height}
         minConstraints={[minWidth, minHeight]}
         maxConstraints={[maxWidth, maxHeight]}
         resizeHandles={['se']}
         onResizeStop={onResizeStop}
         className="border border-slate-700 rounded-lg overflow-hidden"
       >
         <div className="w-full h-full overflow-auto">
           {children}
         </div>
       </ResizableBox>
     );
   }
   ```

### CSS-Based Resizing Strategy

For components that don't require manual resizing but need better space utilization:

1. **StateAnalytics Component**:
   - Increase default width from fixed to responsive percentages
   - Use flex-grow to utilize available space
   - Implement min/max width constraints
   - Current implementation uses a fixed layout that needs to be made responsive

2. **EducationalPanel Component**:
   - Apply responsive height with flex properties
   - Implement overflow handling for content
   - Adjust padding and margins for better space distribution
   - Current implementation has expandable sections that need to work within resizable containers

3. **CircuitBuilder Component**:
   - Reduce spacing between categorized gates (space-y-3 instead of larger gaps)
   - Optimize preset circuits layout from 4 columns to 2 columns
   - Based on requirements, change preset circuits layout from 4 columns to 2 columns to enhance space availability

4. **Main Grid Layout**:
   - Modify the main grid layout to adjust the ratio from 2:1 to 1:2
   - Reduce the gap for better space distribution
   - Current implementation uses `grid lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4` which needs adjustment

## Bloch Sphere 2D Layout Fix

### Current Issues

1. Components are stacked on top of each other
2. Some components extend beyond their boundaries
3. Lack of proper containment within parent components

### Solution Approach

1. **Individual Qubit Panels**:
   - Create separate panels for each qubit in the Bloch Visualizer
   - Implement proper labeling to distinguish which sphere belongs to which qubit
   - Use flexbox or grid with overflow hidden to ensure components stay within bounds
   - Based on requirements, implement individual panels for each qubit in the Bloch Visualizer component to improve visualization clarity

2. **CSS Containment**:
   - Apply `overflow: hidden` to parent containers
   - Use `position: relative` for proper child positioning
   - Implement proper z-index management to prevent overlapping
   - Ensure all components stay within bounds and are properly aligned

3. **Responsive Grid Layout**:
   ```jsx
   <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
     {blochVectors.map((vector, index) => (
       <div key={vector.id} className="bg-slate-800/50 rounded-lg p-4 border border-slate-700/50 overflow-hidden">
         <h3 className="text-sm font-semibold text-indigo-300 mb-3">Qubit {vector.id}</h3>
         {/* Visualization content */}
       </div>
     ))}
   </div>
   ```

4. **Current BlochSphere2D Issues**:
   - The component currently uses a grid layout but has overlapping issues
   - Components extend beyond their boundaries
   - Need to implement proper containment within parent components
   - The layout should use flexbox or grid with overflow hidden to ensure all components stay within bounds

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

1. Install react-resizable library
2. Create reusable ResizablePanel component
3. Define resizing constraints and handles

### Phase 2: Component Resizing Implementation

1. **StateAnalytics Component**:
   - Wrap with ResizableBox
   - Set appropriate min/max constraints
   - Preserve existing functionality

2. **EducationalPanel Component**:
   - Implement resizing with proper content handling
   - Maintain expandable sections functionality
   - Ensure matrix display optimization

3. **CircuitBuilder Component**:
   - Reduce spacing between gate categories
   - Optimize preset circuits layout
   - Implement resizable container

### Phase 3: Bloch Sphere 2D Fix

1. Restructure component layout with proper containment
2. Implement individual panels for each qubit
3. Add clear labeling for qubit identification
4. Apply flexbox/grid with overflow handling

### Phase 4: Main Layout Optimization

1. Modify main grid layout ratio from 2:1 to 1:2
   - Current implementation uses `grid lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4` with `lg:col-span-1` and `lg:col-span-2`
   - Change to `grid lg:grid-cols-3 gap-2` with `lg:col-span-2` and `lg:col-span-1` for better space distribution
   - Based on requirements, modify the main grid layout to adjust the ratio from 2:1 to 1:2 and reduce the gap

2. Reduce gap between columns for better space distribution
3. Implement responsive resizing for both columns

## API Endpoints Reference

No new API endpoints are required for this implementation. All changes are frontend-focused.

However, existing API endpoints used by the components will continue to function as before:
- Quantum Simulation API for StateAnalytics data
- Education Content API for EducationalPanel content
- Visualization APIs for Bloch Sphere data

## Data Models & State Management

### Resizable Component State

```javascript
const resizableState = {
  // Component dimensions
  dimensions: {
    stateAnalytics: { width: 400, height: 500 },
    educationalPanel: { width: 500, height: 600 },
    circuitBuilder: { width: 600, height: 700 }
  },
  
  // Resizing constraints
  constraints: {
    min: { width: 300, height: 300 },
    max: { width: 1000, height: 1000 }
  },
  
  // User preferences
  preferences: {
    isResizingEnabled: true,
    defaultSizes: {
      stateAnalytics: { width: 400, height: 500 },
      educationalPanel: { width: 500, height: 600 }
    }
  }
};
```

### AppContext Integration

The resizable state will be integrated with the existing AppContext:

```javascript
const AppContext = createContext({
  // ... existing state
  resizableState: {
    dimensions: {},
    constraints: {},
    preferences: {}
  },
  resizableActions: {
    updateDimensions: () => {},
    resetToDefaults: () => {},
    toggleResizing: () => {}
  }
});
```

### Component-Specific State

Each resizable component will maintain its own state for dimensions:

```jsx
// In StateAnalytics component
const [size, setSize] = useState({ 
  width: localStorage.getItem('stateAnalyticsWidth') || 500, 
  height: localStorage.getItem('stateAnalyticsHeight') || 600 
});

// In EducationalPanel component
const [size, setSize] = useState({ 
  width: localStorage.getItem('educationalPanelWidth') || 600, 
  height: localStorage.getItem('educationalPanelHeight') || 700 
});
```

## Business Logic Layer
