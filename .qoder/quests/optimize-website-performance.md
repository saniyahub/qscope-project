# QScope Website Performance Optimization Design

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive optimization strategy for the QScope quantum computing educational platform. The optimizations target three key areas:
1. 3D visualization of Bloch spheres for faster rendering and reduced resource consumption
2. API optimizations for the educational content panel to reduce response times
3. OpenRouter API reliability improvements to address timeout issues

## Architecture

### Current System Components
- **Frontend**: React application with Three.js for 3D visualizations
- **Backend**: Flask API with Qiskit for quantum simulations
- **External Services**: OpenRouter API for QChat functionality

### Performance Bottlenecks
1. **Bloch Sphere Visualization**: High WebGL resource consumption, context loss issues
2. **Educational Content API**: Synchronous processing of quantum simulations and analytics
3. **OpenRouter API**: Network reliability and timeout issues with LLM requests

## 3D Visualization Optimization

### Current Implementation Issues
- High polygon count for sphere geometries
- Continuous animation frame updates even when not visible
- No virtualization for multiple Bloch spheres
- Antialiasing enabled which impacts performance
- Missing proper resource cleanup on component unmount

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Reduce Geometry Complexity
- Reduce polygon count for all 3D geometries
- Optimize sphere, arrow, and point representations
- Maintain visual quality while reducing resource usage

#### 2. Implement Visibility-Based Rendering
- Use Intersection Observer API to detect when Bloch spheres are in viewport
- Pause animation frames when components are not visible
- Implement lazy loading for complex visualizations

#### 3. Add Resource Management
- Implement proper WebGL context cleanup
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Introduce throttling for animation updates

#### 4. Virtualization for Multiple Spheres
- Render only visible Bloch spheres in large circuits
- Implement pagination or infinite scroll for multi-qubit systems
- Add simplified 2D representations as fallbacks

### Implementation Plan
1. Modify 3D visualization components to reduce geometry complexity
2. Add visibility detection using Intersection Observer
3. Implement resource cleanup in component lifecycle methods
4. Add performance monitoring utilities
5. Create fallback 2D visualizations for low-end devices

## API Optimization for Educational Content

### Current Implementation Issues
- Synchronous quantum simulation processing blocking API responses
- No caching of educational content or simulation results
- Complex matrix calculations performed on every request
- No request batching for related operations

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Asynchronous Processing with Caching
- Implement caching layer for simulation results
- Add asynchronous job queue for heavy computations
- Return cached data when available

#### 2. Request Batching and Parallelization
- Combine multiple related API calls into single batch requests
- Parallelize independent quantum calculations
- Implement progressive loading of educational content

#### 3. Lazy Loading of Complex Analytics
- Load basic educational content immediately
- Defer complex analytics calculations until needed
- Implement background job processing for heavy computations

### Implementation Plan
1. Add caching layer for simulation results and educational content
2. Implement asynchronous job queue for heavy computations
3. Modify educational content services to use cached data when available
4. Update quantum simulation services to support batch processing
5. Add progressive loading to educational panels

## OpenRouter API Reliability Improvements

### Current Implementation Issues
- Single timeout value for all requests
- No circuit breaker pattern for failed requests
- Limited retry mechanism with basic exponential backoff
- No fallback models or graceful degradation

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Enhanced Retry Mechanism
- Implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add jitter to retry intervals to prevent thundering herd
- Switch to alternative models after failed attempts

#### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Implement failure tracking for OpenRouter requests
- Automatically switch to fallback models after threshold
- Add health checks for API connectivity

#### 3. Model Fallback System
- Prioritize free models during high-traffic periods
- Implement round-robin selection for available models
- Add local fallback responses for common queries

### Implementation Plan
1. Modify QChat service to implement enhanced retry logic
2. Add circuit breaker pattern with failure tracking
3. Implement model rotation and fallback selection
4. Add local response cache for common queries
5. Update timeout configuration for different request types
