# Component Resizing Feature Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for implementing a component resizing feature in the QScope quantum computing educational platform. The feature will allow users to dynamically adjust the size of various UI components to improve their viewing experience and customize the workspace according to their preferences.

QScope is an interactive quantum computing educational platform with a React frontend and Flask backend. The application features a complex UI with multiple panels including a circuit builder, visualization panels (Bloch Sphere, Probability View, Entanglement View), educational content panels, analytics panels, and a QChat assistant panel. Users need the ability to resize these components to optimize their workspace based on their current focus and screen size.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
The resizing feature will be implemented as a reusable hook and utility functions that can be applied to various components throughout the application:

1. `useResizable` - A custom React hook for handling resize logic
2. `ResizableContainer` - A wrapper component for resizable elements
3. `ResizeHandle` - A draggable handle component for initiating resize operations

### Integration Points
The resizing feature will integrate with:
- Circuit Builder panel
- Visualization panels (Bloch Sphere, Probability View, Entanglement View)
- Educational content panels
- Analytics panels
- QChat panel

Based on the existing QScope architecture, these components are arranged in a flexible grid layout that can accommodate resizable elements. The QChat panel is implemented as a side panel that slides in from the right side of the screen, while other components are arranged in the main content area.

#### Specific Component Details
1. **Circuit Builder Panel** - This is the primary interface for creating quantum circuits. Resizing will allow users to expand the grid area for complex circuits or shrink it to focus on visualization panels.

2. **Bloch Sphere Visualization** - The 3D visualization component that shows quantum states. Resizing will allow users to expand the view for better visualization of complex states or shrink it to make room for other panels.

3. **Educational Content Panels** - These panels display explanations and information about quantum concepts. Resizing will allow users to expand them to read longer explanations or shrink them to focus on the circuit builder.

4. **Analytics Panels** - These panels show detailed quantum state information. Resizing will allow users to see more detailed data or reduce the space they take up.

5. **QChat Panel** - This side panel provides AI assistance. Resizing will allow users to adjust the width to better view conversations and responses.

## Implementation Details

### Resizable Hook
```javascript
const useResizable = (initialSize, minSize, maxSize) => {
  const [size, setSize] = useState(initialSize);
  const [isResizing, setIsResizing] = useState(false);
  
  // Handle resize start, during, and end events
  const startResize = useCallback(() => setIsResizing(true), []);
  const resize = useCallback((newSize) => setSize(Math.min(maxSize, Math.max(minSize, newSize))), [minSize, maxSize]);
  const endResize = useCallback(() => setIsResizing(false), []);
  
  return { size, isResizing, startResize, resize, endResize };
};
```

In QScope, this hook will be enhanced to:
- Load initial sizes from localStorage on component mount
- Save sizes to localStorage on resize completion
- Handle different resize directions (horizontal, vertical, both)
- Integrate with the existing AppContext for global state management if needed

### Resizable Container Component
```jsx
const ResizableContainer = ({ 
  children, 
  initialSize, 
  minSize, 
  maxSize, 
  direction = 'horizontal',
  className,
  onResize,
  storageKey
}) => {
  const { size, isResizing, startResize, resize, endResize } = useResizable(
    initialSize, 
    minSize, 
    maxSize
  );
  
  // In QScope, this will integrate with the existing Tailwind CSS grid layout
  // and maintain compatibility with the dark theme styling
  // The storageKey prop will be used to persist sizes in localStorage
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Load size from localStorage on mount
    const savedSize = localStorage.getItem(`qscope_resize_${storageKey}`);
    if (savedSize) {
      try {
        const parsed = JSON.parse(savedSize);
        setSize(parsed);
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn('Failed to parse saved size');
      }
    }
  }, [storageKey]);
  
  const handleResizeEnd = useCallback((finalSize) => {
    endResize();
    // Save to localStorage
    localStorage.setItem(`qscope_resize_${storageKey}`, JSON.stringify(finalSize));
    if (onResize) onResize(finalSize);
  }, [storageKey, onResize]);
};
```

### Resize Handle Component
```jsx
const ResizeHandle = ({ onResizeStart, direction = 'horizontal' }) => {
  // In QScope, this component should use the existing Lucide React icons
  // and match the dark theme styling with slate and indigo colors
  
  const getHandleClasses = () => {
    const baseClasses = 'resize-handle bg-slate-700 hover:bg-indigo-500 transition-colors';
    if (direction === 'horizontal') {
      return `${baseClasses} w-2 h-full cursor-col-resize`;
    } else if (direction === 'vertical') {
      return `${baseClasses} h-2 w-full cursor-row-resize`;
    }
    return baseClasses;
  };
  
  return (
    <div 
      className={getHandleClasses()}
      onMouseDown={onResizeStart}
    />
  );
};
```

## User Interface

### Visual Design
- Resize handles will be subtle UI elements that appear on hover
- Visual feedback during resizing (cursor change, temporary border)
- Smooth animations for size transitions
- Consistent styling with the overall application theme

For QScope, the resize handles should match the existing dark theme with slate and indigo color scheme. Handles should appear on the right edge of panels that can be resized horizontally, and on the bottom edge of panels that can be resized vertically.

### Component-Specific Resize Behaviors

1. **Circuit Builder Panel**
   - Horizontal resizing to adjust the width of the circuit grid
   - Vertical resizing to adjust the height (more qubit rows)
   - Minimum size to ensure at least 3 qubits are visible
   - Maximum size based on screen dimensions

2. **Bloch Sphere Visualization**
   - Both horizontal and vertical resizing
   - Aspect ratio preservation to maintain circular shape
   - Minimum size of 200px to ensure visibility
   - Smooth resizing animation to prevent jarring visual changes

3. **Educational Content Panels**
   - Vertical resizing to show more content
   - Horizontal resizing to adjust text width for better readability
   - Minimum height to show at least title and one line of content

4. **Analytics Panels**
   - Vertical resizing to show more metrics
   - Horizontal resizing to accommodate longer labels
   - Minimum size to show basic metrics

5. **QChat Panel**
   - Horizontal resizing only (maintains right-side positioning)
   - Minimum width of 300px to ensure usability
   - Maximum width of 800px to prevent dominance over main content
   - Resizing should not affect the slide-in animation behavior

### Interaction Flow
1. User hovers over the edge of a resizable component
2. Resize handle becomes visible
3. User clicks and drags the handle to resize
4. Component size updates in real-time
5. On release, new size is saved to user preferences

In QScope, special consideration should be given to the QChat side panel which slides in from the right. The resize functionality should work in conjunction with the existing toggle behavior.

## Data Management

### State Persistence
- Component sizes will be stored in localStorage
- Default sizes defined in constants file
- User preferences will override default sizes
- Size settings will be component-specific

### Storage Structure
```javascript
const componentSizes = {
  circuitBuilder: { width: 600, height: 400 },
  blochSphere: { width: 300, height: 300 },
  educationalPanel: { width: 400, height: 500 },
  analyticsPanel: { width: 500, height: 300 },
  qchatPanel: { width: 500, height: 800 }
};
```

In QScope, these sizes will be stored in localStorage with a key prefix to avoid conflicts with other application data. The QChat panel already has a fixed width of 500px in the existing implementation, which should be used as the default width for the resizable version.

## Business Logic

### Resize Constraints
- Minimum and maximum size limits for each component type
- Aspect ratio preservation where appropriate (e.g., Bloch Sphere)
- Responsive behavior for different screen sizes
- Collision detection to prevent components from overlapping

### QScope-Specific Constraints
- Maintain compatibility with existing keyboard shortcuts
- Preserve the slide-in behavior of the QChat panel
- Ensure resize handles do not interfere with existing UI elements
- Maintain the dark theme styling consistency
- Ensure proper z-index management for resize handles and panels

### Performance Considerations
- Debounced resize events to prevent excessive re-renders
- Optimized reflow operations
- Efficient storage updates
- Smooth animation transitions

In QScope, special attention should be paid to the performance of 3D visualizations (Bloch Sphere) during resizing, as these components are resource-intensive. Resize operations should be optimized to prevent frame drops or stuttering.

## API Integration

### Backend Requirements
No backend changes required for this feature as all data will be stored client-side.

### Event Handling
- Custom events for resize start, during, and end
- Integration with existing event system
- Analytics tracking for feature usage (optional)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test resize hook functionality with various input values
- Validate constraint enforcement (min/max sizes)
- Test persistence layer for saving/loading sizes
- Verify proper cleanup of event listeners
- Test localStorage integration with QScope key naming convention

### Integration Tests
- Test resizing behavior in different components
- Verify visual feedback during resize operations
- Test persistence across sessions
- Validate responsive behavior
- Test interaction with existing QScope keyboard shortcuts
- Verify compatibility with QChat panel slide-in behavior
- Test performance impact on 3D visualizations during resizing

### UI Tests
- Test resize handle visibility and interaction
- Verify smooth animations
- Test edge cases (min/max sizes)
- Validate cross-browser compatibility
- Test dark theme styling consistency
- Verify proper z-index management during resizing
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### QScope-Specific Testing Considerations
- Test resize behavior with different view modes (Bloch, Probability, Entanglement)
- Verify that resizing does not break the educational content loading
- Test interaction between resizing and circuit simulation
- Verify that resize handles do not interfere with drag-and-drop functionality in CircuitBuilder
- Test performance with multiple panels resized simultaneously

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- React (for hooks and components)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Lucide React (for icons in resize handles)

### Internal Dependencies
- AppContext for global state management
- Constants file for default sizes
- Utility functions for storage management
- Existing QScope components (CircuitBuilder, BlochVisualizer, StateAnalytics, etc.)
- BackendClient for any potential analytics tracking

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
1. Create `useResizable` hook
2. Implement `ResizableContainer` component
3. Create `ResizeHandle` component
4. Define constants for default sizes
5. Create utility functions for localStorage persistence

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Integrate with Circuit Builder panel - This is the main panel that takes up a significant portion of the screen and would benefit most from resizing
2. Add resizing to visualization components - The Bloch Sphere, Probability View, and Entanglement View components should be resizable to allow users to focus on specific visualizations
3. Implement for educational panels - The EducationalPanel and LearningPanel components should support resizing to accommodate different amounts of content
4. Add to analytics components - The StateAnalytics component should be resizable to show more detailed information
5. Update QChat panel - The QChatSidePanel should support resizing while maintaining its slide-in behavior

### Phase 3: Polish and Testing
1. Add visual feedback and animations
2. Implement persistence layer
3. Conduct unit testing
4. Perform integration testing
5. Test with existing QScope keyboard shortcuts and UI interactions
6. Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
7. Test with existing dark theme styling

## Configuration and Customization

### Default Sizes
Default sizes for each component will be defined in a constants file:

```javascript
const DEFAULT_SIZES = {
  circuitBuilder: { width: 600, height: 400 },
  blochSphere: { width: 300, height: 300 },
  educationalPanel: { width: 400, height: 500 },
  analyticsPanel: { width: 500, height: 300 },
  qchatPanel: { width: 500, height: 800 }
};
```

### User Preferences
Users will be able to reset all resize preferences to defaults through a settings menu. A "Reset Layout" option will clear all saved sizes from localStorage and revert to default dimensions.

## Future Enhancements
- Keyboard shortcuts for preset sizes
- Resize presets (small, medium, large)
- Grid-based layout system
- Touch support for mobile devices
- Snap-to-grid functionality
- Resize animations with configurable duration
- Per-user resize preferences stored on backend (for logged-in users)
