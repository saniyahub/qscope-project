### 3. Bloch Sphere 3D - Interactive Quantum State Visualizer

**What It Does**: The Bloch Sphere 3D component transforms abstract quantum mathematics into beautiful, interactive 3D visualizations that you can explore with your mouse. Each qubit in your circuit gets its own sphere showing exactly what state it's in.

**Visual Elements**:

**The Sphere Itself**:
- **Transparent Sphere**: Represents all possible states a qubit can be in
- **North Pole (Top)**: The |0⟩ state - like a classical "0" bit
- **South Pole (Bottom)**: The |1⟩ state - like a classical "1" bit
